# CyberDefender

## Introduction

Welcome to CyberDefender, a Python project to monitor and investigate cyber intrusions, detect suspicious activity, and calculate the likelihood of an intrusion using Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and LogisticRegression. This project is a work in progress, and as such is a prototype that should be built upon and extended to become more powerful.

## Goals

- Develop an AI-based system to detect cyber intrusions
- Create an algorithm to calculate the likelihood of an intrusion
- Utilize Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and LogisticRegression to create a powerful system
- Develop a system that can be used by corporations and individual users
- Create a system that can be used to help protect against cyber attacks

## Roadmap

1. Develop a system that can detect suspicious activity
2. Utilize machine learning algorithms to identify potential intrusions
3. Create an algorithm to calculate the likelihood of an intrusion
4. Implement Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and LogisticRegression
5. Develop a system that can be used by corporations and individual users
6. Create a system that can be used to help protect against cyber attacks
7. Test and refine the system to ensure accuracy

## Features

- AI-based system to detect cyber intrusions
- Algorithm to calculate the likelihood of an intrusion
- Utilization of Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and LogisticRegression
- System that can be used by corporations and individual users
- System that can be used to help protect against cyber attacks

## APIs

This project utilizes several APIs, some of which are closed-source and a work in progress. As such, they will not be released to the public due to licensing agreements. It is recommended that users create an open-source alternative to any closed-source APIs used.
